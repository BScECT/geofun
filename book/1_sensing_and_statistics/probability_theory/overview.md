# Probability Theory

In this chapter you will learn about the fundamental concepts of probability. We will start by explaining why probability theory is needed, and how probability can be defined. You will learn about probability rules, and then we move on to probability distributions to model the *random* nature of natural phenomena, experimental outcomes, measurements, etcetera.

Topics per section:

* [Introduction to probability](IntroP): uncertainty, definition of probability, set theory
* Conditional probability and independency: conditional probability, total probability rule, Bayes' rule, independence
* Discrete probability distributions
* Continuous probability distributions
